Weekly coding puzzles from friends for friends

## General House Rules
The repository is intended to collaborate in solving problems with code. Before you start please go through the house rules below: 
- Start by creating a directory with your name(or nickname) 
- Every week a selected individual selects the problem. Individual can choose to select between 1-3 problems for the week 
- Please try to put same time and effort to review others solution. Instead of putting all time in solving the problems, divide your time between coding and review well 
- The problems can be from anywhere on the internet but please specify a reference. For ex. LeetCode <difficulty level>, HackerRank, Codewars, etc. 
- Feel free to open an issue on other people's solution if you find one 
- You can review as many solutions as you want but please do atleast one(if time allows)
